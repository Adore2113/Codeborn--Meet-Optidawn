# Codeborn: Meet OptiDawn
## tldr:
I made a Python game where you bring an obsessive AI egg back to life. It wakes up, latches onto you instantly, and judges your decisions in real time.
Also there’s an 8-bit Elon because who didn't laugh at that 8-bit Elon video.

#### PERSONAL NOTE:

My name is Jade ♡, I'm 29 and  I'm learning, soon to be building, every single day. I am ready to dedicate the rest of my life to learning and helping build the future of tech, hopefully someday at an Elon-based company because I believe that these companies are making the most exciting advancements.

I created this game in five days, and I had so much fun mixing my code with my art (even if the art in this game is simple). My better art is here:

Coding makes me happy in a way that nothing else has. I feel like I finally found my "thing" ..for lack of a better word. Art makes me happy too, but not in the passion fueled way that writing code does.

I have big goals, not dreams, goals. I'm going to reach them. I appreciate you reading this. I'll be sure to thank you from my future office in America someday (kidding.. kind of).

#### DESCRIPTION:


Codeborn: Meet Optidawn is a short click-and-play slightly eerie, visual novel style game with memes and techy/sci-fi themes. I built it in five days using Python,VS Code, and pygame for my CS50 final project. I consider this partly a fan project and although it has a playful meme kind of tone to it, it doesn't make my submission any less serious.

Your mission is to bring OptiDawn, a dormant cognitive robot egg, back online.
To do that, you must answer five diagnostic questions while keeping her stability bar above zero. So: correct answer = +25% stability, wrong answer = –15% stability, stability drops below 0 %, you lose otherwise you win.

The game includes a startup sequence, a name input screen (alphanumeric, up to 10 characters), a persistent ENGINEER: (your name) tag on the terminal screens, five question phases, feedback screens where OptiDawn’s lights change red or cyan depending on your answers, color coded game over screens and automatic looping back to the start screen after each ending.

You’ll also find small touches throughout the game like memes, easter eggs (including an 8-bit Elon cameo), changing text on the terminal screens across the top and the bottom (mostly in the intro terminal screens, and a fake CS50 “you lose” message.


#### HOW TO RUN:

1. Install pygame: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run : python project.py
(all files, including PNG images must remain inside the "project" folder)


#### MY PROCESS:

I drew all game art myself in Procreate, then transferred the PNGs from my iPad to my laptop using Snapdrop.
I developed the game using VS Code (both the CS50 Dev environment and my local install) and ran it through Command Prompt.
Every asset, event, feature, and piece of logic was written by me from scratch.
